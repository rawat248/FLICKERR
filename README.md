# **FLICKER** #
A flicker React app that uses React hooks, React Router, the Context API, would allow users to search for and view images from the flicker photo app. The app would use React hooks to manage the state of the application and handle user interactions such as submitting a search query and viewing individual images such as mountain, beaches etc. React Router would be used to allowing users to navigate between different pages of the app.

The Context API would be used to manage and share global state across the different components of the app. Api is used in this project which shows different images. We make image URL with conditions which shows images with category based.
